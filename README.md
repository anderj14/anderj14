I'm a **Software Engineer** who loves creating software that helps people and teams go further. I’m passionate about building solutions that are not only functional but meaningful — from modernizing systems to crafting tools that make work smoother and smarter.  

I’m fascinated by how **AI** can reshape the way we build and learn, and I’m constantly exploring new technologies that make a real impact. I believe in learning by doing, sharing knowledge, and growing alongside others. 🌱
